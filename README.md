# Dopamine

Dopamine is an elegant audio player which tries to make organizing and listening to music as simple and pretty as possible. This version is written using Electron, Angular and Typescript. The original Dopamine (for Windows), which is written in WPF and C#, remains available <a href="https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine-windows">here</a>.

## Build instructions

Due to the native dependency better-sqlite3, this project cannot be built for all platforms on GNU/Linux. The GNU/Linux packages must be built on GNU/Linux, the Windows package must be built on Windows and the MacOS package must be built on MacOS.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine.git
$ cd dopamine
$ npm install                # Install dependencies
$ npm start                  # Start Dopamine
$ npm run electron:windows   # Build for Windows
$ npm run electron:linux     # Build for Linux
$ npm run electron:mac       # Build for Mac
```

## Pacman installation notes

The pacman package contains a dependency to package libappindicator-sharp, which is no longer distributed with Arch Linux. I cannot remove this dependency for now, because it is an issue in electron-builder (the packaging tool which is used in this project). It is, however, possible to install Dopamine on Arch Linux or Manjaro using this command:

`$ sudo pacman -U Dopamine-3.0.0-preview.3.pacman --assume-installed libappindicator-sharp`
