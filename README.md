# Dopamine

Dopamine is an elegant audio player which tries to make organizing and listening to music as simple and pretty as possible. This version is written using Electron, Angular and Typescript. The original Dopamine (for Windows), which is written in WPF and C#, remains available <a href="https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine-windows">here</a>.

Escaping Characters

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character.

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

The rendered output looks like this:

* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
Characters You Can Escape

You can use a backslash to escape the following characters.
Character 	Name
\ 	backslash
` 	backtick (see also escaping backticks in code)
* 	asterisk
_ 	underscore
{ } 	curly braces
[ ] 	brackets
< > 	angle brackets
( ) 	parentheses
# 	pound sign
+ 	plus sign
- 	minus sign (hyphen)
. 	dot
! 	exclamation mark
| 	pipe (see also escaping pipe in tables)
HTML

Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.

To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file.

This **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic.

The rendered output looks like this:

This word is bold. This word is italic.
HTML Best Practices

For security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check your Markdown applicationâ€™s documentation. Some applications support only a subset of HTML tags.

Use blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like <div>, <table>, <pre>, and <p> from the surrounding content. Try not to indent the tags with tabs or spaces â€” that can interfere with the formatting.

You canâ€™t use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example, <p>italic and **bold**</p> wonâ€™t work.
